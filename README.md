## What  
I made a browser extension that is basically a password manager specifically for AWS. IT IS OPEN SOURCE (for the security freaks). As of now, it stores passwords in plaintext but I'm working on evaluating different approaches for that.  


## Why
AWS accounts are very very difficult to manage. Multiple screens, multiple inputs. My existing password managers felt inadequate. They wouldn't be able to remember all 3 inputs, or links properly. 

At the time, I was freelancing for multiple organizations at once related to AWS and had lots of AWS Accounts to manage (multiple from the same org as well because of IAM enthusiasts lol). Because of my continued interest in AWS, I've always worked with multiple AWS Accounts and realized that a better solution to manage multiple accounts should exist.

## Key features/objectives

- Help with *many* accounts:
  - Custom aliases, reorder the list, tracking last used timestamps
- Help with many clicks
  - Auto submit on every browser on autofill
- Help with power users with multiple browsers/devices and want secure sync
  - Can export and import csv files to share and reduce manual work.

## How

To those who are curious enough, they can always visit the GitHub repository, and contact me if they want to contribute with feature ideas. I used Plasmo framework combined with React. Good simple setup. Used tailwind ui for the styling! Find the link to the GitHub repository at the top of the post!

You can find the Extension on all browsers (I even have a fairly satisfying CI/CD!)!

## What Now?

Good question! I and some of my friends have been using it and enjoying it well over the last few months. It even got several daily active users (~50) total across the three browsers combined quite organically. So I want you guys to try it out, and let me know what you think! Its completely open source so I'd love for more people to get involved if they like! You can also just make feature requests and I'd definitely take them up because I'm desperate for external validation (/s? LoL)
